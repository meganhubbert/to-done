### From "To Do" to Done
A to-do list app to help you get ðŸ’© done!

Notes:
- I plan to create a way for the app to utilize local storage to persist your data so you don't lose your list if you refresh or navigate away from the page.
- I have several plans to update the complexity of this app, including:
  - create a "To-Do Later" and "Done" category
  - building out a tracker to help visualize how many of your tasks you've completed (we love visual feedback!)
  - implementing a drag and drop feature to sort your tasks into new categories
  - using inspiration from dribbble to create a more visually pleasing UI
